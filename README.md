[Stripe](https://stripe.com) can notify your application of events using webhooks. This package can help you handle those webhooks. Out of the box it will log the events to the database. You can easily define jobs that should be executed when specify events hit your app.

Before using this package we highly recommand reading [the entire documentation on webhooks over at Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks).

## Postcardware

You're free to use this package (it's [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md)), but if it makes it to your production environment we highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.

Our address is: Spatie, Samberstraat 69D, 2060 Antwerp, Belgium.

We publish all received postcards [on our company website](https://spatie.be/en/opensource/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-stripe-webhooks
```

The service provider will automatically register itself.

You must publish the config-file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\StripeWebhooks\StripeWebhooksServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the config file that will be published at `config/stripe-webhooks.php`

```php
return [

    /**
     * Stripe will sign webhooks using a secret. You can find the secret used at the webhook
     * configuration settings: https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks
     */
    'signing_secret' => '',

    /**
     * Here you can define the job that should be run when a certain webhook hits your .
     * application. The key is name of stripe event type with the `.` replace by `.`
     *
     * You can find a list of stripe webhook type here:
     * https://stripe.com/docs/api#event_types
     */
    'jobs' => [
        // 'source_chargeable' => \App\Jobs\StripeWebhooks\SourceChargeable::class,
        // 'charge_failed' => \App\Jobs\StripeWebhooks\ChargedFailed::class,
    ],

    /*
     * The class name of the model to be used.
     */
    'model' => App\Models\StripeWebhookCall::class,
];
```

In the `signing_secret` key of the config file you should add a valid webhook secret.  You can find the secret used at [the webhook configuration settings on the Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks).

Next, you must publish the migration with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\StripeWebhooks\StripeWebhooksServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

After the migration has been published you can create the `stripe_webhook_calls` table by running the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

The lasts steps take care of the routing. At [the Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks) you must configure at what url Stripe webhooks should hit your app. In the routes file of your app you must pass that url to `Route::stripeWebhooks`:

```php
Route::stripeWebhooks('webhook-url-configured-at-the-stripe-dashboard')
```

Behind the scenes this will register a `POST` route to a controller provided by this package. Because Stripe has no way of getting a csrf-token, you must add that route to `except` array of the `VerifyCsrf` middleware .

```php
protected $except = [
    'webhook-url-configured-at-the-stripe-dashboard',
];
```
